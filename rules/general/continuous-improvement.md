## Continuous Improvement (TDD Evidence)

- **Evidence-driven**: Propose improvements backed by failing tests or perf metrics.
- **Pattern capture**: When a pattern appears in 3+ files, add/update rules.
- **Security/perf**: Create tests that prevent regression (headers, query counts).

### Process

1) Detect issue or opportunity with data/tests
2) Write failing tests capturing the gap
3) Implement minimal change → green
4) Communicate summary with impact and risks
